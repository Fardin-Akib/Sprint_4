# Sprint_4

Welcome!! This is a file used to build the web application for my project to conclude Sprint 4. Within this collection you will find a csv file, a jupyter notebook, and a "myApp.py" file that will be used to run a website via streamlit and render. The website will contain two visual graphs based on the dataset of vehicles sold from the csv file. 

To access the website simply click on the link below.
